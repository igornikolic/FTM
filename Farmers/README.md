This is the exploration of the data accomapnying the article [Acht misvattingen over boeren (in negen grafieken)](https://www.ftm.nl/artikelen/boer-en-veehouder-ontzien)

Data provided by [Ties Joosten](https://www.ftm.nl/auteur/ties-joosten)

# Some ideas for further exploration
* Add a geographic dimension , where in the country are the poor/rich farmers
* Link to economic input-output data, as visualised by [the Observatory of Economic Complexity](https://oec.world/en/) 
* Show subsidy amounts over time, stretching back to last 20 or 30 years, to show effect of various Dutch governments.
